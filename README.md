## Analysing the Impact of Altering Paywall Headline on Subsription Rate

An A/B Test is a randomized experiment in which a two or more variants a variable are deployed to different segments of customers to determine which of the version is most effective in boosting KPIs. 

For this case, we will be analysing the A/B test results data of an (ficticious) online learning platform called MindMapers. MindMappers operates on a freemium model, some of its courses are free, but the advanced courses are locked behind a paywall. MindMappers provides a 2 week trial for its advanced courses. At the end of the trial period, users are directed to a paywall. Two paywall variants with differing headlines were compared in this A/B test. We'll conduct a **hypothesis test** to evaluate if an alternative paywall headline is worth implementing.

**For those who are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks**, please review the analysis by clicking on the **ipynb** file and inspecting the preview which appears.
